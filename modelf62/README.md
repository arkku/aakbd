## Brand New Model F62 Keyboard Alternative Firmware

This subdirectory of [AAKBD](https://github.com/arkku/aakbd) contains an
alternative firmware for the Brand New Model F62 keyboard, ported from
QMK and xwhatsit.

## Configuration

Set `DEVICE` to `modelf62` either in `local.mk` (in the project root directory),
or on the command line (i.e., `make DEVICE=modelf62`).

## Note

This is a work in progress.
