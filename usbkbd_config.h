/**
 * usbkbd_config.h USB HID keyboard configuration.
 *
 * This header contains a list of available configuration options.
 *
 * The best place to configure these is to create a file called `local.mk`
 * and in that file put `CONFIG_FLAGS =` followed by the options with a `-D`
 * prefix for each, for example:
 *********************************************************************
        CONFIG_FLAGS = \
            -DUSB_MAX_KEY_ROLLOVER=10 \
            -DUSB_VENDOR_ID=0x16C0 \
            -DUSB_MANUFACTURER_STRING='"Manufacturer"'
 *********************************************************************
 *
 * Note that you need to escape double quotes in that file, such as with '.
